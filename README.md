# Blockchain Voting System Smart Contract

This Clarity smart contract implements a secure and transparent voting system on the blockchain. It allows for candidate registration, vote casting, and result querying, all while ensuring the integrity and transparency of the voting process.

## Contract Overview

The contract provides the following main features:
1. Candidate registration
2. Secure voting mechanism
3. Vote counting and result querying
4. Voting period control

## Data Structures

- `total-votes`: A variable that keeps track of the total number of votes cast.
- `votes`: A map that associates each voter (by their principal) with their vote status.
- `candidates`: A map that stores the list of candidates and their respective vote counts.
- `voting-open`: A boolean variable that controls whether voting is currently open or closed.

## Functions

### Admin Functions

#### 1. `register-candidate`
- **Parameters:** `name` (string-ascii 50)
- **Description:** Registers a new candidate for the election.
- **Restrictions:** Can only be called by the contract owner.

#### 2. `close-voting`
- **Parameters:** None
- **Description:** Closes the voting period, preventing any further votes from being cast.
- **Restrictions:** Can only be called by the contract owner.

### Public Functions

#### 1. `cast-vote`
- **Parameters:** `candidate` (string-ascii 50)
- **Description:** Allows a user to cast a vote for a specified candidate.
- **Restrictions:** 
  - Voting must be open.
  - Each principal (user) can only vote once.

### Read-Only Functions

#### 1. `get-votes`
- **Parameters:** `candidate` (string-ascii 50)
- **Description:** Retrieves the number of votes for a specific candidate.

#### 2. `get-total-votes`
- **Parameters:** None
- **Description:** Returns the total number of votes cast in the election.

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract to the blockchain.
2. The contract owner should register candidates using the `register-candidate` function.
3. Users can cast their votes using the `cast-vote` function while voting is open.
4. Anyone can query the current vote counts using `get-votes` and `get-total-votes`.
5. Once the voting period is over, the contract owner can close voting using the `close-voting` function.

## Security Considerations

- Only the contract owner can register candidates and close voting.
- Each user (identified by their principal) can only vote once.
- Votes cannot be cast after voting is closed.
- All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## Potential Improvements

1. Implement a voting period with automatic closure.
2. Add functionality to allow voters to change their votes before voting closes.
3. Implement a more sophisticated voter registration system.
4. Add events to notify external systems of important contract actions.

## Disclaimer

This smart contract is a basic implementation and may need further testing and auditing before use in a production environment. Ensure proper security measures are in place when deploying and using this contract for real-world applications.
